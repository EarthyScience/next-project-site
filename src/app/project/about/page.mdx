# <WP number={4}> Task T1.2: Observations and Data Products in the Ocean </WP>
[lead: VLIZ; contributions: UHAM]

- **Objective**: Identify transport pathways of heat and carbon and improve the representation of marine heatwaves and their impacts.
- **Approach**: Upscale sparse in-situ ocean measurements and satellite data and use machine learning algorithms to harmonize global temperature and dissolved carbon fields as well as high-resolution coastal air-sea CO2 flux reconstructions.
- **Focus Area**:
    1. Meridional heat and carbon transport in the Southern Ocean.
    2. Air-sea CO2 exchange.
